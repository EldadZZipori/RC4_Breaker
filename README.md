# RC4_Breaker
Digital design - Codebreaking Hardware Acceleration/Parallel processing

# SOF file location

# Lab status
### Task 1 ✔️
    Creating RAM, instantiating it, and writing to it.

#### Pseudocode
    for i in 0 to 255 {
        s[i] = i;
    }  
### Task 2 ✔️
    Building a single Decryption Core.
    Shuffling working memory (S), reading ROM (D) of encrypted data, decrypting data, write decrypted message to RAM (DE).

#### Pseudocode
    j = 0
    for i = 0 to 255 {
        j = (j + s[i] + secret_key[i mod keylength] ) 
        swap values of s[i] and s[j]
    }
    i = 0, j=0
    for k = 0 to message_length-1 {
        i = i+1
        j = j+s[i]
        swap valsues of s[i] and s[j]
        f = s[ (s[i]+s[j]) ]
        decrypted_output[k] = f xor encrypted_input[k]
    }
### Task 3 ✔️
    Craking an RC-4 decryption, writing the current key to a HEX, indicating success on an LED.

    Brute forcing the correct key for a message using a single core. The key is generated by an LFSR.
